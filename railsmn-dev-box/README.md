# A Virtual Machine for Getting Started with Ruby on Rails

__We want to make it easy for you to create Ruby on Rails applications.__

One hurdle we have seen for Rails newcomers is installing and configuring Ruby on Rails on their computers.  This tool sets up of a Ruby on Rails development environment.  Follow the steps below. If you have questions, please feel free to [create an issue (really!)](http://github.com/railsmn/railsmn-dev-box/issues).


Includes
--------
* Ruby 2.0.0 (binary RVM install)
* Rails 4.latest
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Git
* RVM
* Bundler
* Node.js for the asset pipeline
* System dependencies for nokogiri


## Getting started

### Step 1 - Install stuff
Install 3 packages (programs).

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - [downloads page](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
  + choose Operating System specific package

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) - [downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  + click on system specific link under "VirtualBox platform packages"

* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) - [downloads page](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
  + click on latest edition
  + choose Operating specific package


### Step 2 - Build Vagrant Virtual Machine
**Windows Users: Go directly to step 2b**

In the terminal application,

    git clone git://github.com/railsmn/railsmn-dev-box.git
    cd railsmn-dev-box
    vagrant up

#### Step 2b - Windows Users Only:
If you would like to have access to the open_camp project files *outside* of your Vagrant box (ie: to use your favorite text editor on Windows - like Notepad++ or similar) follow these steps before running the 'vagrant up' command.

1.	Create a folder on your Windows computer (typically in the Desktop or 'My Documents' directory) - your open_camp project will be accessible from here.
2.	In your GithubUI application, clone the repository available at git://github.com/railsmn/railsmn-dev-box.git - see http://windows.github.com/help.html for more info on how to do this.
3.	Once downloaded, open the 'railsmn-dev-box' folder on your computer, using File Explorer.
4.	Now, go back to the folder you created in Step 1, and copy the [FULL PATH](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff678296.aspx)
5.	Next, we want to edit the 'Vagrantfile' file. Open it with your favorite text editor, and edit the line that reads: ```config.vm.share_folder "open_camp_directory", "/home/vagrant/open_camp", "**Windows Folder Path**"```

	Replace the 'Windows Folder Path' text with the FULL PATH that you copied in Step 4.

	**IMPORTANT:** Windows will, by default, paste something like this ```"C:\Users\Mo\Desktop\open_camp_folder"``` Make sure that you change out the backwards slashes, and replace them with forward slashes. The end result should look something like this:
	```config.vm.share_folder "open_camp_directory", "/home/vagrant/open_camp", "C:/Users/Mo/Desktop/open_camp_folder"```
6. 	In your Git Shell (ie: Start -> Applications -> Github -> Git Shell), CD into the directory from Step 2 (ie: Where the ```Vagrantfile``` exists).
7.	Run the ```vagrant up``` command.
* 	More information about this process is available on the [Vagrant project's website](http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/config/vm/share_folder.html)

### Step 2 (all users) continued
The above commands,
- Download the base Linux image
- Create and start the Vagrant Virtual Machine
- Can take anywhere from 3-45 minutes, depending on your machine and internet connection.

### Step 3 - SSH into Virtual Machine
In the terminal application,

    vagrant ssh    # NOTE: now you have SSH-ed into the Vagrant Virtual Machine (VM)

    vagrant@rails-dev-box:~$

### Step 4 - Create a Rails app
Using the same SSH connection from Step 3,

    rails new open_camp
    cd open_camp


### Step 5 - Configure Mongoid to connect to the local MongoDB


### Step 6 - Start the Rails server
Using the same SSH connection from Step 4,

```
rails server
```

Open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Virtual Machine Management

To __exit__ SSH connection to Vagrant Virtual Machine,

    exit        # option 1

    # press ^D  # option 2


To __suspend__ virtual machine,

    # from your computer

    vagrant suspend


To __resume__ virtual machine,

    # from your computer

    vagrant resume


To __shutdown/halt__ virtual machine,

    # from your computer

    vagrant halt


To __resume__ virtual machine,

   # from your computer

   vagrant up


To get __status__ of virtual machine,

    # from your computer

    vagrant status


To completely delete virtual machine,

    # from your computer

    vagrant destroy   # DANGER: all is gone


Please check the [Vagrant documentation](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/index.html) for more information on Vagrant.
